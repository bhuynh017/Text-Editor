# Text-Editor

## User Story

- AS A developer
- I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
- SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Summary

- The purpose of this app is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. This app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Application
